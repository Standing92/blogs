            <h1>Why Should I Network? Understanding Networking and its Benefits</h1>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As an extremely shy individual, I hear your complaints and sighs after reading this title. The idea alone of awkward conversations, cheesy events, and the feeling that you need to "sell yourself" to be successful is enough to make anyone shudder. But while networking may often seem intimidating and awkward in the initial stages, gaining and maintaining a strong and receptive professional networking system is essential to professional success.</p>
            
            <h2>The Importance of Networking</h2>
            <p>No matter what your chosen career is, networking is essential to making connections, gaining support systems, and learning about opportunities to progress your career. In short, networking is what makes the difference between someone who has a mediocre career and an amazing one. With a little bit of effort, a good network will allow you to build mutually beneficial relationships with your colleagues and associates. Furthermore, when a network is established you will be the first to hear about new job opportunities and promotions from anyone who is looking to hire someone that has your skills and experience.</p>
            
            <h2>How to Start Networking</h2>
            <p>While it may seem complicated, networking is everywhere around you. Whether it's an informal get together or a business meeting. In both cases, networking starts out with the goal to establish new connections and foster new relationships. People that you should network with include everyone from colleagues, former teachers and peers, recruiters who specialize in your field, and even friends and family members in your industry.</p>
            <p>Begin building a network by attending networking events, volunteering at local clubs and organizations, connecting online through websites like LinkedIn or attending industry meetups</p>
            
            <h2>Benefits of Networking</h2>
            
            <h3>Strengthening Your Professional Connections</h3>
            <p>This one may seem obvious but building and maintaining a sense of trust with members of your network allows for the creation of a reciprocal relationship in which both parties are able to share things like job opportunities, business tips and new ideas. By making yourself available to help your contacts, you facilitate a communicative setting in which you are able to ask for assistance if you were to need it.</p>
            
            <h3>Exchanging Ideas</h3>
            <p>Your network can be a priceless source for new ideas and perspectives. Regularly engaging with your contacts and communicating with them about experiences, challenges, and goals is key to stay on top of industry news and alter your business to best suit the changing climate. In addition to this, networking is a great way to learn about new business techniques and stay on top of the latest industry developments. A wide network of knowledgeable and informed individuals increases the likelihood of you learning information that is relevant to your success.</p>
            
            <h3>Find Your Dream Job</h3>
            <p>Did you know that most jobs on the market are not even advertised? According to a statistic by Forbes, over 70% of jobs are taken before they are even posted publicly, making networking an even more essential skill in order to gain new job opportunities and further your career. Networking and letting employers know your skillset and ambitions may make them more likely to consider asking you to take the role before advertising it publicly, ensuring that you would be the first to hear about new openings and potentially even take advantage of some of them.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While getting started on networking may seem intimidating, understanding where to start and who to network with may help you to get started. Remember, once you find a couple of contacts, you may be able to connect with more people through them and expand your network so that you can experience some of the amazing benefits that networking results in as well.</p>
