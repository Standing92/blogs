            <h1>Niche Vs. General Services in Marketing</h1>
            
            <h2>What is Marketing and Why is Proper Marketing for Your Business Important?</h2>
            <p>Marketing is referred to as the activities that a business partakes in to promote the usage of its services or buying of its goods, and there are a vast number of ways one could go about promoting their business. For many new or smaller businesses, it is vital and very popular to engage in marketing. In fact, roughly 90% of small businesses invest in some form of marketing, whether that be making a social media page or sending emails to prospective customers. Especially for smaller businesses, marketing is often showcasing one's work or services in order to draw in new customers. One of the most common reasons that businesses fail within the first few years is because they do not properly market their products or services, which leads to a lack of consumers. Seeing as small businesses are usually in a more precarious financial situation, and finances are also a common reason for business failure, it's extremely important that small businesses market themselves properly in order to develop their consumer base. Most businesses choose to market their services or products to either a specific or general group of people, and it is very important that one chooses the best option for their products and services.</p>
            
            <h2>What is 'Niche' in Business?</h2>
            <p>While nearly all businesses capitalize off of their niche to some extent, niche services are considered to be specialized services or cater to a specific kind of customer. The beauty industry, projected to be worth about 670 billion by the end of 2024, is one of the most lucrative places to find a niche, particularly for small or home-based businesses. The beauty industry encompasses everything from hairstylists to nail technicians to lash technicians, most of which provide a specialized service to a consumer base that appreciates how their work reflects a certain aesthetic. For example, many home-based hairstylists cater to a certain hair type or certain styles and braids, and most lash technicians specialize in either thick or wispy lash extensions. Many of these businesses create social media pages promoting their products, prices, and the city in which they operate.</p>
            <p>The great part about a niche consumer base is that the business provides a service that most other businesses don't provide, which is great for building a consistent and loyal customer base. Social media is a great way to find and promote these services, however, businesses that mainly promote niche services will often see some kind of loss in their new and general customer base, though this is usually not of great concern. Also, if a niche service is not provided properly, a business may lack a customer base completely.</p>
            <p>A great example of this is Russian manicure services, which specialize in elegant, simple, and natural-looking nail styles, however, the process of creating this clean look includes removing the cuticle. Many people do not appreciate the simplicity of the style, but alongside that, if the cutting away of the cuticle or sanitization processes are done incorrectly, it can result in infection. While Russian manicures are a very profitable niche to build upon, if one were to perform them incorrectly, they would have no service to build upon and a waning consumer base.</p>
            
            <h2>What is Considered General Services and Products?</h2>
            <p>When a business provides general services or products, that means that they provide a variety of products and services to a customer base. Regardless of how broad the marketing of products and services are, all businesses specialize to some degree, even larger corporations like Walmart or Target, but many larger chain stores capitalize on having a variety of products, like food, popular books, basic sporting equipment, and clothes. While many large corporations rely on selling a wide variety of products, many small businesses similarly rely on providing a large range of services.</p>
            <p>Remaining within the context of the beauty industry, many home-based hair stylists who work with curly hair types offer wig installs, as well as many styles of braids. These small businesses, while they do often specialize slightly, capitalize off of having a relatively wide customer base that will pay for their services. Many of these hair stylists run social media pages showcasing the range of their work, and bring in customers because of their general ability and competence within their sphere. The downside of this is that they may not have the most loyal customer base, or the ability to specialize in and promote a certain style. Regardless, many businesses like this are still very profitable because they retain the ability to consistently bring in new customers.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Properly providing and marketing to a consumer base can be tricky, but it is a very important component of business and one of the keys to success.
