            <h1>Natural Monopolies</h1>
            <p>Imagine your city's electricity provider. If five different companies tried to build separate power grids across town, you'd see endless construction, skyrocketing bills, and chaos. This is why natural monopolies exist, they're industries where one company can deliver services more efficiently than multiple competitors.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Do Natural Monopolies Happen?</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Massive Upfront Costs:</strong> Building infrastructure like power grids requires huge investments. A single provider avoids repeating these costs, keeping prices lower for everyone.</p>
            
            <p><strong>"Bigger Is Cheaper":</strong> As companies grow, their cost per unit drops (economies of scale).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Infrastructure Limits:</strong> You can't have six competing sewer systems under your street.</p>
            
            <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Utilities (Water, Electricity, Gas):</strong><br>
            Building separate power lines for multiple companies is wasteful. One grid is cheaper to maintain, which is why most cities have a single utility provider.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Rail Networks:</strong><br>
            Laying parallel train tracks for competitors is impractical. Governments often grant exclusive rights to one operator but regulate fares to prevent abuse.</p>
            
            <h2>The Regulation Tightrope</h2>
            <p>Natural monopolies can lower costs, but without oversight, they might increase. Here's how the government intervenes:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Price Caps:</strong> Regulators limit how much companies can charge.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Public Ownership:</strong> Some utilities are government-run to guarantee fair access.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strict Oversight:</strong> Private monopolies in industries like railways face audits and service quality checks.</p>
            
            <h2>Are They Still Relevant?</h2>
            <p>Technology is reshaping some sectors. Telecom, once a classic natural monopoly, now thrives with wireless competition. Yet industries like electricity and water remain monopolistic due to their infrastructure-heavy nature. Even tech giants like Google or Facebook face scrutiny for network effects that mimic natural monopolies, dominating markets where users attract more users.</p>
